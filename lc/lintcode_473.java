Connected Component in Undirected Graph
Find the number connected component in the undirected graph.
 Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors. 
 (a connected component (or just component) of an undirected graph 
    is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other 
    by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.)
